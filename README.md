# Rappel
Library Management System
With this project I was able to solve the problem of returning the books to library in my college on time. This project is for librarian and book should be returned on or before 14 days. On 13th day a mail is sent to the student saying that the time limit is completed. My application saves the details of book, students, and the books taken by the students and also scans the Id card to recognise the identity of the student taking the book.
This might not run for you cause this only works for institution.

Step 1:Install python
Step 2:Install db3 module,impor t sqlite3,import time, import cv2,pillow module.
Step 3:RUn the file project.py
